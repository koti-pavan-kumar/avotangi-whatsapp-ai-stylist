# n8n to Make.com Migration Notes

## Migration Date
March 2026

## Reason for Migration
- n8n Cloud trial ended after 14 days
- Make.com offers stable free tier with 1,000 operations/month
- No ongoing costs for demonstration/portfolio purposes

## Technical Differences

### n8n Implementation
- Node-based visual workflow
- JavaScript code in function nodes
- Self-contained product database in code
- Webhook-triggered execution

### Make.com Implementation
- Module-based visual scenario
- Same webhook trigger approach
- Same API integrations (Twilio, Groq)
- Enhanced visual interface

## What Remained Identical
✅ All API endpoints (Twilio, Groq)
✅ Business logic and flow
✅ Product recommendations algorithm
✅ AI prompting strategy
✅ Response times (2-3 seconds)
✅ Error handling approach

## What Changed
- Platform-specific UI (nodes → modules)
- Webhook URL (n8n → Make.com domain)
- Scenario scheduling (always-on vs triggered)

## Migration Time
Approximately 60 minutes total

## Lessons Learned
- Workflow logic is platform-agnostic
- API-based architecture enables easy migration
- Visual automation tools share similar concepts
- Proper documentation enables rapid rebuild

## Current Status
🟢 **LIVE** on Make.com - fully operational
